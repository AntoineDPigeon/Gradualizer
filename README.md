# A Gradual Type System for Erlang

This tool is a type checker for Erlang.

* The type system is based on the principles of Gradual Typing
* It works with the existsing type specs syntax in Erlang.
* Without any type specs, no static typing happens.

  When adding type specs the program becomes more statically typed.
